In this method,we decompose A into its diagonal component D and the remainder R $$ A = D + R $$ So the equation can be rewritten as: $$ Dx = b - Rx $$ According to the equation above,we can get the iterative formula: $$ x^{k+1} = D^{-1}(b-Rx^{k}) $$ So the iterative formula is what we want\nBut according to the method we explained above,we have many questions.\nWhy do we decompose A into its diagonal component D and the remainder R Why we iterate Is the iteration reliable We will try to answer them. Where does it come from #\rAccording to the reference I found, this method actually comes from Splitting methods. If we have a matrix A such that A = M - N and M is nonsingular, we refer to M and N as a splitting of the matrix A. So we have $$x^{k+1}=M^{-1}(b+Nx^{k})$$ In this choice,we can D is easy to invert.So we come up with it. But now I don\u0026rsquo;t know how we can come up with Splitting methods.\nThe iteration #\rThe Iteration idea comes from that if we know other element in x except x[i],we can get it from others.Through this,we can get closer to the real x.It converges because of fixed-point iteration specifics.\nReliability #\rWe define $$e^{k} = x^{k} - x$$.\n$$Ax = b$$.So according to the $$x^{k+1} = D^{-1}(b-Rx^{k})$$,we get $$ e^{k+1} + x = D^{-1}(Ax-R(e^{k}+x)) $$ $$ e^{k+1} + x = D^{-1}(Dx-Re^{k}) $$ $$ e^{k+1} = -D^{-1}Re^{k} $$ It can converge\nlimitation #\rWe can get the assumption from our analysis.\nD can invert.So the coefficient matrix A has no zeros on its main diagonal. \\(e^{k+1} = -D^{-1}Re^{k}\\) need to converge.So The A is diagonally doominant Reference #\rGeeksforGeeks.
